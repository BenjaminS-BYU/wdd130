            Hello there! My name is Benjamin Strong. I am currently living in Alberta, Canada. I have been married for
            about 5 years
            now and have 2 beautiful children. My son just had his first day at school today! Super exciting. I am
            learning web
            development and game dev at the same time and learning a lot from both!
