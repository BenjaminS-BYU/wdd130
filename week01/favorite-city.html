    <h1>My Favorite City</h1>
    <p>
        My favorite city is Edmonton, AB here in Canada. The city is vast and beautiful. I use to live in a nice little
        neighborhood where I would walk around and listen to an audiobook! Our neighborhood was covered in trees and was
        on the edge of a beautiful river that spanned the length of the city! Quite beautiful indeed. There is also so
        much diversity, I ate at so many different places and tried so many different foods! I loved it!
