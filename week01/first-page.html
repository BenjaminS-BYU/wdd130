<!--Image notes-->
<!--
.jpeg or .jpg stands for Joint Photographic Experts Groups: uses compression to make images light weight
Compression finds patterns in the images individual pixels and represents those patterns with much less code

.gif (Graphics Interchange Format) only supports 256 colors only for simple animations 

.png (Portable Network Graphics) uses lossless compression

.webp (Google web picture) more modern way to make images smaller developed by google also supports animation 

.svg (Scalar Vector Graphics) not resolution dependent used for shapes texts, sketches and logos not used for photographs

.heic (High Efficiency Image Container) this is a newer format for pictures taken on mobile, offers better compression
than .jpeg tho not well supported on the web

The standard for this course is that all images need to be less than 100kB in memory size.
